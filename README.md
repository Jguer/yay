# Yay

Yet Another Yogurt - An AUR Helper Written in Go

### Help translate yay: [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/yay-1/yay/)

## Features

- Advanced dependency solving
- PKGBUILD downloading from ABS or AUR
- Completions for AUR packages
- Query user up-front for all input (prior to starting builds)
- Narrow search (`yay linux header` will first search `linux` and then narrow on `header`)
- Find matching package providers during search and allow selection
- Remove make dependencies at the end of the build process
- Un/Vote for packages

## Installation

If you are migrating from another AUR helper, you can simply install Yay with that helper.

### Source

The initial installation of Yay can be done by cloning the PKGBUILD and
building with makepkg:

Before you begin, make sure you have the `base-devel` package group installed.

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so:

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel && git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay && makepkg -si
```


### Binary

If you do not want to compile yay yourself you can use the builds generated by
GitHub Actions.

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

### Other distributions

If you're using Manjaro or [another distribution that packages `yay`](https://repology.org/project/yay/versions)
you can simply install yay using pacman (as root):

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel yay
```

⚠️ distributions sometimes lag updating yay on their repositories.

## First Use

#### Development packages upgrade

- Use `yay -Y --gendb` to generate a development package database for `*-git`
  packages that were installed without yay.
  This command should only be run once.

- `yay -Syu --devel` will then check for development package updates

- Use `yay -Y --devel --save` to make development package updates permanently
  enabled (`yay` and `yay -Syu` will then always check dev packages)

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Yay does not display colored output. How do I fix it?**

    Make sure you have the `Color` option in your `/etc/pacman.conf`
    (see issue [#123](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/123)).

- **Yay is not prompting to skip packages during system upgrade.**

    The default behavior was changed after
    [v8.918](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/releases/tag/v8.918)
    (see [3bdb534](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/commit/3bdb5343218d99d40f8a449b887348611f6bdbfc)
    and issue [#554](https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/554)).
    To restore the package-skip behavior use `--combinedupgrade` (make
    it permanent by appending `--save`). Note: skipping packages will leave your
    system in a
    [partially-upgraded state](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported).

- **Sometimes diffs are printed to the terminal, and other times they are paged via less. How do I fix this?**

    Yay uses `git diff` to display diffs, which by default tells less not to
    page if the output can fit into one terminal length. This behavior can be
    overridden by exporting your own flags (`export LESS=SRX`).

- **Yay is not asking me to edit PKGBUILDS, and I don't like the diff menu! What can I do?**

    `yay --editmenu --nodiffmenu --save`

- **How can I tell Yay to act only on AUR packages, or only on repo packages?**

    `yay -{OPERATION} --aur`
    `yay -{OPERATION} --repo`

- **An `Out Of Date AUR Packages` message is displayed. Why doesn't Yay update them?**

    This message does not mean that updated AUR packages are available. It means
    the packages have been flagged out of date on the AUR, but
    their maintainers have not yet updated the `PKGBUILD`s
    (see [outdated AUR packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Foo_in_the_AUR_is_outdated.3B_what_should_I_do.3F)).

- **Yay doesn't install dependencies added to a PKGBUILD during installation.**

    Yay resolves all dependencies ahead of time. You are free to edit the
    PKGBUILD in any way, but any problems you cause are your own and should not be
    reported unless they can be reproduced with the original PKGBUILD.

- **I know my `-git` package has updates but yay doesn't offer to update it**

    Yay uses an hash cache for development packages. Normally it is updated at the end of the package install with the message `Found git repo`.
    If you transition between aur helpers and did not install the devel package using yay at some point, it is possible it never got added to the cache. `yay -Y --gendb` will fix the current version of every devel package and start checking from there.

- **I want to help out!**

    Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

- **What settings do you use?**

    ```sh
    yay -Y --devel --combinedupgrade --batchinstall --save
    ```

    Pacman conf options:

    ```conf
    UseSyslog
    Color
    CheckSpace
    VerbosePkgLists
    ```

## Support

All support related to Yay should be requested via GitHub issues. Since Yay is not
officially supported by Arch Linux, support should not be sought out on the
forums, AUR comments or other official channels.

A broken AUR package should be reported as a comment on the package's AUR page.
A package may only be considered broken if it fails to build with makepkg.

Reports should be made using makepkg and include the full output as well as any
other relevant information. Never make reports using Yay or any other external
tools.
