[1m[35m2020-01-04[0m[0m [1mNow using Zstandard instead of xz for package compression[0m
As announced on the mailing list, on Friday, Dec 27 2019, our package compression scheme has changed from xz (.pkg.tar.xz) to zstd (.pkg.tar.zst).

zstd and xz trade blows in their compression ratio. Recompressing all packages to zstd with our options yields a total ~0.8% increase in package size on all of our packages combined, but the decompression time for all packages saw a ~1300% speedup.

We already have more than 545 zstd-compressed packages in our repositories, and as packages get updated more will keep rolling in. We have not found any user-facing issues as of yet, so things appear to be working.

As a packager, you will automatically start building .pkg.tar.zst packages if you are using the latest version of devtools (>= 20191227).
As an end-user no manual intervention is required, assuming that you have read and followed the news post from late last year.

If you nevertheless haven't updated libarchive since 2018, all hope is not lost! Binary builds of pacman-static are available from Eli Schwartz' personal repository (or direct link to binary), signed with their Trusted User keys, with which you can perform the update.

Our [36mrsync[0m package was shipped with bundled [36mzlib[0m to provide compatibility
with the old-style [36m--compress[0m option up to version 3.1.0. Version 3.1.1 was
released on 2014-06-22 and is shipped by all major distributions now.

So we decided to finally drop the bundled library and ship a package with
system [36mzlib[0m. This also fixes security issues, actual ones and in future. Go
and blame those running old versions if you encounter errors with [36mrsync

The software behind planet.archlinux.org was implemented in Python 2 and is no longer maintained upstream. This functionality has now been implemented in archlinux.org's archweb backend which is actively maintained but offers a slightly different experience.

The most notable changes are the offered feeds and the feed location. Archweb only offers an Atom feed which is located at here.

[1m[35m2020-02-24[0m[0m [1mThe Future of the Arch Linux Project Leader[0m
Hello everyone,

Some of you may know me from the days when I was much more involved in Arch, but most of you probably just know me as a name on the website. Iâ€™ve been with Arch for some time, taking the leadership of this beast over from Judd back in 2007. But, as these things often go, my involvement has slid down to minimal levels over time. Itâ€™s high time that changes.

Arch Linux needs involved leadership to make hard decisions and direct the project where it needs to go. And I am not in a position to do this.

In a team effort, the Arch Linux staff devised a new process for determining future leaders. From now on, leaders will be elected by the staff for a term length of two years. Details of this new process can be found here

In the first official vote with Levente Polyak (anthraxx), Gaetan Bisson (vesath), Giancarlo Razzolini (grazzolini), and Sven-Hendrik Haase (svenstaro) as candidates, and through 58 verified votes, a winner was chosen:

Levente Polyak (anthraxx) will be taking over the reins of this ship. Congratulations!

Thanks for everything over all these years,
Aaron Griffin (phrakture)
